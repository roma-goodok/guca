## Milestones
(Done) M1: Frontend MVP (more or less attractive): can interactively visualize just a few hardcoded genes (can be selected). The Graph Unfolding Machine (which implements graph unfolding cellular automata) should be implemented in TypeScript.

(Done) M2: Graph Evolution Lab - implement the first version of the evolution algorithm and reproduce some old experiments using CPU parallelization.

(Done) M3: Make Frontend more attractive and ready to publish.

(Done) M4: Improve Graph Evolution Lab to conduct experiments faster and more conveniently, reproducibly (using ClearML for experiment tracking and visualization).

(Done) M5: Prepare a public project's web page (e.g., GitHub Pages)
- Article
- Source code published
- Examples of visualization

First, let's focus on the M1 milestone. I already have the GUCA rules (in C#) (see the implementation of the Graph Unfolding Machine in C# below with comments in Russian, including all the rules). Please:

1. Analyze it.
2. If you have any questions to clarify the implementation of the GraphUnfoldingMachine in the new web-based frontend (guca-visualization Git project), please ask.
3. Provide a JSON format.
4. Propose a high-level plan to implement M1.

Project Path: {{ absolute_code_path }}

I need your help to add some improvements and/or features to my project (an interactive web application in TypeScript). Here are the files involved:

Source Tree:
```
{{ source_tree }}
```

{{#each files}} 
{{#if code}}
`{{path}}`: 

{{code}}

{{/if}}
{{/each}}

Here is the list of improvements,new features and instructions:

Before executing the instructions:

Review the code carefully and systematically.
1. Trace the relevant code paths.
2. Run the code mentally with example inputs.
3. Think about interactions between components.
4. Take a deep breath and think step by step about how to best complete this task.

For each change, please provide:
1. The file path.
2. A description of the modification and explanation.
3. A code snippet (lines, functions) that needs to be changed.

(!) You don't need to return all the lines of the modified files. Only if I ask for it.

After analysis, please update the code with your proposed modifications. Try to match the existing code style. Add regression tests if possible to prevent bugs from recurring.
I appreciate your diligence and attention to detail! Let me know if you need any clarification on the intended behavior of the code.
